\textbf{Senior Power Systems Optimization Engineer -- Camus Energy $|$ 2022--present}

At Camus Energy Dr. Laws develops novel software to aid electric utilities in the energy transition,
including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automation of utility data into power flow models, including SCADA, AMI, and GIS.
    \item Novel graph methods to determine system connectivity of power distribution systems.
    \item Optimal power flow methods for dynamic operating envelopes to support flexible
    interconnection of new storage and generation assets.
    \item Optimal inverter based resource set points to support utility objectives
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{REopt Lead Developer -- NREL $|$ 2021-2022}

Dr. Laws led the transition of REopt to an open-source Julia package and Python-based API to support
a web tool (\href{http://reopt.nrel.gov/tool}{reopt.nrel.gov/tool}) as well as make the REopt tool
more accessible and customizable.
\newline
\newline
\noindent
\textbf{Co-optimizing distributed energy resources for system operator and customer objectives $|$ 2020}

Dr. Laws acted as Principal Investigator on a competitively awarded internal research and
development grant at NREL on novel methods to determine optimal capacities and economic incentives
for distributed energy resources from multiple perspectives.
\newline
\newline
\noindent
\textbf{Value of Resiliency Laboratory Directed R\&D $|$ 2018}

Dr. Laws supported an NREL internally funded research and development project to determine methods for
valuing the resiliency of energy storage and generation assets for all stakeholders, including asset
owners, grid operators, and society.
\newline
\newline
\noindent
\textbf{National Scale Analysis of the Economics of Commercial Behind-The-Meter Solar Plus Storage $|$ 2017}

Dr. Laws' first project at NREL required adapting and scaling an in-house analysis tool that
required an expert analyst weeks to months to curate many inputs and analyze the outputs into a tool
that could be automated for tens-of-thousands of runs to support a national scale analysis of where
in the United States behind-the-meter solar plus storage was economical for commercial building
owners.

\section*{Biography}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{}Biography}
Dr. Nick Laws is the Director of Modeling and Analytics at IdeaSmiths. He is also the Senior Power
Systems Optimization Engineer at Camus Energy, where he researches and develops methods and software
to aid electric utilities in the energy transition. Prior to Camus Energy, Dr. Laws led the
development of a flagship decision support tool at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL),
called REopt. REopt is a techno-economic optimization tool for determining distributed energy
resource (DER) capacities and dispatch strategies to meet economic, resilience, and emission
reduction goals.  Dr. Laws is the sole-author of the 2022 “Centralized Control of DER with Price
Signals” NREL software record, developed to control diverse DER with minimal information exchange.
Dr. Laws also served as Principal Investigator on the 2020 NREL Seed Laboratory Directed R\&D project
“Co-optimizing DER for system operator and customer objectives”. Dr. Laws is passionate about
preserving wild spaces for future generations and enjoying wilderness with family and friends.
